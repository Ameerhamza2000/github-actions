# github-actions

Github Actions are used for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployement (CI/CD).We create github actions in "main" repository by " .github/workflows/file_name_here.yml " . 

I have created node.js workflow in pullrequest.yml file used for lint and build on a pull request.Lint makes your code bugs free, formats and Build makes executeable code useful .
